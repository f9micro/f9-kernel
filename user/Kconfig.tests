	  Machine-parseable test suite for automated CI/CD.

	  Commands:
	    make run-tests              - Run test suite
	    make run-tests FAULT=mpu    - Run MPU fault test
	    make run-tests FAULT=canary - Run stack canary test

	  Test suite verifies IPC, threads, timer, and KIP.
	  Fault tests verify MPU protection and stack overflow detection.

	  For reliable results, disable other user apps (L4_TEST,
	  PINGPONG) when running tests to avoid memory contention.
